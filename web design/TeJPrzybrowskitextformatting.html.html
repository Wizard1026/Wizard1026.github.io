 <p></p><q>Joe Bob said he had his first airplane ride at the 2019 airport awareness days and it was the best day of his life!"<q> Visitors from all ages and all of the tri-county come out to experience this once a year event. <em> Some think this even is better than the fireman's parade. Many piolets value the vistors and the attention the awareness day brings to the airport it helps raise much needed funds for repairs to the airport in addition to raising attention from those who may be intereseted in flying their personal plane from this airport. 
<p></p>While some may think flying is just for the rich you may be surprised to know that the airport offers flying lessons so you may become your own pilot. Often times young adults take lessons and then move on to the military life to fly for the Unisted states military or even the Blue Angels group. Many pilots are common folks enjoying that freedom feeling they get or adrenialine rush. Either way one might be new to the idia or a long time lover and really enjoy spending the day at the airport awareness days.
